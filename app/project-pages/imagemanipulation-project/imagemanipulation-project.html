    There are 3 BMP related programs: <hr />
    1. COPY which copies a bmp to another bmp (slightly different than CMD's cp command) <hr />
    2. RESIZE which resize a bmp image <hr />
    3. WHODONIT which reveals an image from underlying static (red pixels). <hr />

    Starting with RESIZE, an example run would be to transform this little dot right here:
    <img src="https://ideallyconnected.me/cs50projects/pset4/smiley.bmp" /> <hr />
    to this (30 times the size):
    <img src="https://ideallyconnected.me/pset4/largersmiley.bmp"/>
