My Portfolio

### Git Management
There are currently three branches: development, production and master. Development is taking place
on windows using npm http-server so anything being placed in development branch should work well with
that set up. The production branch will have a near final product which should be tested on the production
server, apache2 on linux machines. Master contains that latest functional product which can be publicly
viewed at [portfolio.ideallyconnected.me].

Created using AngularJS. Initialized with [angular-seed].
